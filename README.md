<h2>What does position mean?</h2>

In physics, we love to precisely describe the motion of an object. Seriously, the first few chapters of basically every physics textbook are devoted to teaching people how to precisely describe motion since it is so important to everything else we do in physics.
<br>
But to describe an object's motion, we have to first be able to describe its position—where it is at any particular time. More precisely, we need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board (Figure 1). In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but rather are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame (Figure 2).

The variable xxx is often used to represent the horizontal position. The variable yyy is often used to represent the vertical position.

<h2>What does displacement mean?</h2>

If an object moves relative to a reference frame—for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a whiteboard, or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane—then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word displacement implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced.

<b>Displacement</b> is defined to be the change in position of an object. It can be defined mathematically with the following equation:
